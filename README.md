# Touch dragging system

### Usage
- Add all scripts in Assets/Scripts/DragInput to your project
- Attach TouchDragManager as a component to a single GameObject in the scene. Configure the options as you want them.
- Attach Draggable as a component to any object that should be draggable (requires that it has a RigidBody2D)

After following these steps, any object with the Draggable component can be dragged by the user.
